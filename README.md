===============================
This is the arcade game for Haoyu's FEND projects.

How to play?
Use you arrow keys to move you player as up, down, left, right.
Make sure you player doesn't collide with the moving bugs.

What is the detailed game rule?
It's a simple game, your goal is to move your character across the grass and rocky road to the river side, once you achieve the goal, you get a star in the right bottom coner . The game has three round, once you achieve the goal, you win one round and next round will begin. You don't have any stars when game starts, so if you have three stars, you are the winner of the game. Notice that the game could become more difficult in the next round, and you have three hearts in the left bottom coner when game starts, if your player collide with the bugs, you lose this round and one heart, if there is no heart to lose, then game is over.

How I build this?
I built this cute game on top of the Udacity FEND arcade game, with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
